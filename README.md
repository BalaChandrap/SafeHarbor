SafeHarbor: A Privacy-Focused Android Browser
SafeHarbor is an open-source, privacy-focused browser for Android devices, built on the Chromium platform. Our mission is to provide a secure and ad-free browsing experience with no trackers, giving users the confidence to surf the web safely and privately.

Features
No Trackers: SafeHarbor does not send user data or browsing history to third parties.
Incognito Mode: Enhanced private browsing mode that does not store any local data and automatically clears cookies and cache upon closing.
Ad Blocker: Integrated ad-blocking mechanism to filter out intrusive ads.
Privacy-focused Search Engine: SafeHarbor uses a privacy-focused search engine by default, with user-customizable options.
Secure Browsing: Implementation of HTTPS Everywhere and additional security layers to protect against malicious websites and phishing attacks.
